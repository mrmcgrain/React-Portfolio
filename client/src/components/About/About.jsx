<p>I'm on a journey. Pursing greatness and fulfillment through the artistry of code.</p>
<p>In a recently completed, year long boot-camp with a company I adore "Persevere Now",</p>
<p>not only have I found my calling and my passion - I have also found a burning need to be </p>
<p>to be of service to my fellow human-kind who have battled their ways through the justice</p>
<p>system. We are on a combined mission with some amazing organizations to "End Recidivism"</p>
<p>and show the world what we are really capable of... when only given the chance to do so!</p>
<br />
<p><strong> Complex logic, functionality and Algorithms are my church...JavaScript my drug of choice!</strong> </p>
<p>Let's find the solution to whatever ails your project together! </p>
<p>Be part of the change that will help heal the world.. </p>
